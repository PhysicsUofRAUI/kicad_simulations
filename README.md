# KiCAD Simulations
A place to store example simulations using KiCAD.

# Contributing
Feel free to contribute your example circuits by submitting a pull request. Follow these two guidelines:

1. Keep it simple
  - I want to have a collection of really simple simulation circuits so people can use them for reference while building more complex Simulations
  - Think like a capacitor charging circuit or a classic OpAmp cicuit (like the ones I'm trying to build). Focus on one component to demonstrate how to simulate that component
2. Add your circuit to the table.
  - try to place it in a file location that makes sense
  - don't worry about making a video unless you want to (I want to make videos, but I know others may not)


# Chart of Simulations and Explanation videos
| Circuit | Location | Video |

| Inverting OpAmp | op_amps/ideal_inverter | |
| Non-inverting OpAmp | op_amps/non-inverter | |
| OpAmp Follower | op_amps/follower | |
| Differential Amplifier | op_amps/differential-amplifier | |
